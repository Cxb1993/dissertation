* Thesis Statement Notes
** Goals
   - Exploring simulation of plastic surgery flap operations on isolated regions and the scalp
   - Exploring potential performance opportunities stemming from lattice based deformers
   - Understanding issues and challenges with designing and deploying simulation tools in practical settings
** Deliverables / Results

     - High performance elastic simulation
     - Support for topological cutting
     - Support for advanced, nonlinear material models
     - Support for rigid body collisions
     - Distributed deployment model with multiple simultaneous web front-ends
   - Approval / excitement of domain expert
   - Several peer-reviewed papers covering core technologies
     - Advanced material models with lattice deformers (Patterson 2012)
     - Supporting high performance surgical simulation (Mitchell 2015)
     - Non-manifold levelsets for high performance self collisions (Mitchell 2015)
     - Optimized schur-complement block solvers for lattice deformers (Mitchell 2016)  
   - Feasibility demo demonstrating core software functionality and deployment design
** Revision notes (March 16 2017)
   - dimension (geometry?) geometry and space, materiality
   - purpose - enumerate concrete, but disjoint examples
   - challanges come after specific example (they make more sense)
      - Cater to needs, talk about medical simulation, talk about concrete and abstract, and how the abstract connects with specific instance
      - utility
	- observing behaviors recognising patterns
	  - if these are useful, does our reconstruction match these real properties
	  - visual - identitgy landmarks
        - need to comprise, where and when?
          - utility, what is important to us
        - not all comprises are equal
